 * The Risk endpoint allows you to retrieve various
 * information pertaining to a user's calculated risk.
 * Risk profiles are generated for each underlying account
 * and include an overall score, a breakdown of the score
 * by various contributing parameters, and the extent of
 * data available for analysis.
 * 
 * Plaidâ€™s risk algorithm detects abnormal behavior by
 * comparing new bank accounts to an internal database.
 * While directly detecting risky behavior is challenging,
 * we use our large dataset to identify normal patterns.
 * Once an account is found to deviate from our definition
 * of normal in our carefully chosen parameter space it
 * is flagged as abnormal.
